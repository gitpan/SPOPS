SPOPS: Simple Perl Object Persistence with Security

QUICK INSTALL NOTE
====================

Installing via the CPAN shell is always a good thing, otherwise just
do the standard:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make 
 make test
 make install

Note that the first step will ask you a few questions that determine
which tests are run.

Also, there is a 'Bundle' for SPOPS. If you're using the CPAN shell,
just do:

 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::SPOPS'

Easy!

WHAT IS IT?
====================

SPOPS is a robust and powerful module that allows you to serialize
objects. It is unique in that it also allows you to apply security to
these objects using a fairly simple but powerful scheme of users and
groups. (You can, of course, turn off security if you want.)

It's also unique in that for most objects, you will not need to write
any code. It's true! A fairly simple configuration file is all you
need which you can then feed to SPOPS and have a class for your object
ready to go, right out of thin air.

The configuration you specify not only lists the properties of the
object and possibly some information about where its data should be
stored, but can also describe the relationship an object might have
with another object (or objects).

One great benefit is that you can retrofit SPOPS to existing data. If
you don't use any of the metadata layers or security, you can simply
describe your data in a configuration file, process the configuration
and start making (and processing) objects! If you want to add security
to these objects later, it's easy!


SHOW ME THE CODE!
====================

Here's a sample session. In it, we have a simple configuration file
which names the table in our database and the fields in the table,
along with the primary key field. We process the config, then create a
new object with our just-created class.

(Note that this code is copied directly from the file
'eg/fatbomb_dbi.pl'. See it for more details or to run it yourself.)

 my $spops = {
      fatbomb => {
        class        => 'My::ObjectClass',
        isa          => [ qw/ SPOPS::DBI::MySQL SPOPS::DBI / ],
        field        => [ qw/ fatbomb_id calories cost name servings / ],     
        base_table   => 'fatbomb',
        id_field     => 'fatbomb_id',
        increment_field => 1,
        skip_undef   => [ qw/ servings / ],
        sql_defaults => [ qw/ servings / ],
      },
 };
 
 SPOPS::Configure::DBI->process_config( { config      => $spops,
                                          require_isa => 1 } );
 My::ObjectClass->class_initialize;
 
 my $object = My::ObjectClass->new;
 $object->{calories} = 1500;
 $object->{cost}     = '$3.50';
 $object->{name}     = "Super Deluxe Jumbo Big Mac";
 my $fb_id = eval { $object->save( { db => $db } ) };
 if ( $@ ) {
    my $ei = SPOPS::Error->get;
    die "Error found! ($@) Error information: ", Dumper( $ei ), "\n";
 }
 print "Object saved ok!\n",
       "Object ID: $fb_id\n",
       "Servings:  $object->{servings}\n";

We can strip out the 'skip_undef' and 'sql_defaults' items in the
configuration and we'd have the bare minimum configuration for a
SPOPS::DBI object. (The 'increment_field' key exists because we're
using the AUTO_INCREMENT feature of MySQL.)


APPLICATION-SPECIFICITY 
====================

Up to now, this library has been tied relatively closely to the
OpenInteract project (www.openinteract.org, or check out the CPAN
module OpenInteract). However, it should be able to stand on its own
two feet -- we've used it like this without any problem. But there
might be a few assumptions lurking around the code somewhere. If you
spot something that looks totally out of place or appears to have no
real purpose, let us know!


HOW DO I SAY IT?
====================

It's usually pronounced so it rhymes with 'mess mops', although you're
free to make up your own.


DO YOU HAVE A LIBRARY FOR <insert name here>?
========================

Maybe. Near-future development will include:

 LDAP (using Net::LDAP by default, but you'll be able to plug in other
 drivers like Mozilla::LDAP)

 Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (using DBD::Sybase -- tested briefly)

 Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere (using DBD::ASAny -- tested briefly)

 Oracle (using DBD::Oracle)

 DB2 (using DBD::DB2)

 Postgres (using DBD::Pg)

 Interbase (using DBD::Interbase)

 MS SQL Server (using DBD::ODBC, FreeTDS?)

 CORBA (likely using CORBA::ORBit in the beginning)

Have something else you want implemented? Let us know! We might be
able to do it ourselves, or we might be able to help you out.

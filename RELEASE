0.50 Tue Aug 28 16:59:39 EDT 2001

  * Added SPOPS::LDAP and accompanying modules.

  * Object code generation totally rewritten, and should be
    understandable now! If existing code used SPOPS::Configure instead
    of SPOPS::Initialize, it will have to be changed.

  * See 'Changes for detailed modifications.


0.41 Fri Jul 20 07:02:01 EDT 2001

  * Added SPOPS::Iterator and implementation SPOPS::Iterator::DBI to
    deal with large resultsets in a sane manner.

  * Changes (positive!) to testing framework.

  * See 'Changes' for detailed modifications


0.40  Sun Jun 10 14:50:20 EDT 2001

  * Upgraders need to rename two fields in 'sys_security', both of
    which were changed to get around reserved terms in various
    databases.

     oid   --> object_id
     level --> security_level

    In MySQL, you can run:

    ALTER TABLE sys_security CHANGE oid object_id VARCHAR(150)

    ALTER TABLE sys_security CHANGE level security_level CHAR(1)

  * For detailed changes, see the 'Changes' file.


0.39

  * If you're using 'AUTO_INCREMENT' fields for SPOPS::DBI::MySQL, you
    *must* create a new key in your object configuration:

    'increment_field' => 1,

    You don't need to modify anything else.

  * SPOPS.pm (root class for all SPOPS objects) now inherits from
    Storable, using the methods 'store()', 'retrieve()' and
    'nstore()'. If you have methods with these names in your object
    then you won't be able to use the Storable functionality.
